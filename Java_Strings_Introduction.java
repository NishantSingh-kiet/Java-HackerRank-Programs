/*Java Strings Introduction
"A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." â€” Wikipedia: String (computer science)
This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:
String myString = "Hello World!"
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
Sum the lengths of  and .
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than  B(i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Input Format
The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.
Output Format

There are three lines of output: 
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B. 
For the second line, write Yes if  A is lexicographically larger than B or No if it is not. 
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input
hello
java

Sample Output
9
No
Hello Java

Explanation
String A is "hello" and B is "java".
A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4 ; the sum of their lengths is9 . 
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" comes before "java"; therefore, A is not larger than B and the answer is No.
When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
